# Credit

Some of the recourses I used to understand how to build this project:
- [UC Davis Lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g&si=jGMOqZBvyhRn1Lgz) for scanline rasterization, geometry culling, and the graphic pipeline.
- [Tiny Renderer](https://haqr.eu/tinyrenderer/) used some files (vector class, and tga image importer class)
